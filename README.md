It is a Webpage made to help me and any person using it, learn kanji. 
It it very simple and consists only of typing in the input box the corressponding answer to the mode you chose. 
either the meaning of the kanji or the On/Kun reading of it. 
It is in French so if you don't speak it you can still learn the reandings if you want.
It is my first HTML project so it might be mid :/.
